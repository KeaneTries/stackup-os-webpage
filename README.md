# stackup os
Disclaimer: This is meant to be a simple project for a monthly challenge within the stackup community.

## motivation
you can clearly see this project is heavily inspired by the buildspace os. since the steps to install are the same, i will respect their original work and keep them below.
for more detailed elaborations, check out the project link in the description of this project.

## setup
### you don't need to write any code or know how to code to set this up. It will take 2 mins max â€” promise

**we even made a 2 min vid for you**

once you get there you'll see "Developer mode" in the top right. make sure to toggle that **on** and then you'll see new options (we're gonna be using "Load unpacked")<br>

### 3. add the app to your browser
you're at the home stretch! press the "Load unpacked" option and then go to the folder where you saved buildspace os. it should look something like this:<br>

### 4. open a new tab
now you can see this thing in action! Open a new tab and you'll notice that there is a prompt saying that the page was changed by the buildspace os extension. **Make sure to select keep it or it will not work.**<br>
